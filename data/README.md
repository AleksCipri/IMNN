# Data file

This file contains the file for calculating the continuum flux for the LISA problem (`continuum.txt`).

The `pickled` files containing the results presented in the paper are also available here.

Finally, the plots which are used in the README.md markdown on the home page of the `information_maximiser` are kept here.
